# BSSPy

## Just run it for now check if codes are working. A detailed tutorial is coming soon. 

## Packages required:
 

# BSSPy

The package has codes for the Bayesuian State Space Model. It is a generic state space model, the dynamics is specified in the individual demo files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things Packages need to install:

```

### Execution

For now :
```
